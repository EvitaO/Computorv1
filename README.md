#ComputorV1

This project aims to make you code a simple equation solving program. It will take polynomial equations into account. These equations will only require exponents. No complex function. The program will have to display its solution(s).

The program must solve a polynomial of second or lower degree equation and show at least:
• The equation in its reduced form.
• The degree of the equation.
• It’s solution(s) and the polarity of the discriminant if it makes sens.

Bonus:
• Manage entry mistakes
• Display the intermediate steps
• Display solution as an irreducible fraction if it's interesting
